# gflib
Genetic Folding Open source library

Genetic Folding algorithm is a member of the Evolutionary algorithm’s family uses simple floating points for genes in representing the chromosomes.

The github page presents GFLIB, a Genetic Folding MATLAB toolbox for supervised learning problems. In particular, the goal of GFLIB is to build a concise model of supervised learning, a free, open source MATLAB toolbox for performing classification and regression. 

The GFLIB specifically designed for most of the features traditionally used to evolve in applications of mathematical models. 
The toolbox suits all kinds of users, from the users who implemented GFLIB as a “black box”, to the advanced researcher who wants to generate and test new functionalities and parameters of GF algorithm. 

To run the GFlib toolbox directly to your PC do the following:
1. Add the folder to Your Matlab project
2. Add libsvm to the project
3. run binary.m for binary classification problems
4. run multi.m for multiclassification problems
5. run regress.m for regression problems
